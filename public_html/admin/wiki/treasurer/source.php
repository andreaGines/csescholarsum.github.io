</ul>
<p>UMEC funding form: http://umec.engin.umich.edu/currentforms/FundingForms/index.html </p>
<ul>
<li> BE AS DESCRIPTIVE AS POSSIBLE.  seriously.  we get much more money if we can say EXACTLY what the money is used for.  e.g. "We need $462 because the food for our event will come out to $341 (from past experience), and the board games we are using for volunteering will cost $121 (prices researched online)" </li>
<li> No funding for transportation or gas. NOTE: this could change, check with UMEC </li>
<li> Talk to Jen Wegner to get our name out, possibly get more money </li>

<h1> EXAMPLE FUNDING REQUEST FOR UMEC</h1>
<ul>
<li> note: this example disregards the character limits on the form.  you shouldn't... </li>
<li><b><u>Event Open To</u></b>: This event is open to Students interested in CSE scholars.  We advertise this to everyone on our Interested Email list (~450 people on this list).  We use Community service as a requirement for full membership to our club.  This event will count towards the required hours for membership in CSE scholars.</li>
<li><b><u>How will this benefit the Community?(NOTE: consult with Community service chair for this, and write one that's better than this example)</u></b>: We are helping clear lots and planning for a sustainable housing project that will help Brightmoor Gardens house volunteers on-site.  Brightmoor Gardens is a neighborhood garden in the middle of Detroit. They garden year-round thanks to a large green-house they built. By volunteering, we are showing our University's dedication to outreach, as well as help out the Michigan community grow and be sustainable. </li>

<li><b><u>How will you define success? (see above note)</u></b>: Success: Since this event will be a recurring event once a month starting now, we hope to see our progress build overtime, and eventually see a finished shelter for the Brightmoor community.  We also hope to see our members excited to help out their community and see them return for more events.
</li>
<li> <b><u>How will the funding be used?</u></b>: We will be using the funding for buying lunch for our volunteers.  Currently we have 14 members signed up for the event.  We estimated 2 to 3 slices of pizza per person.  This adds up to about 5 pizzas.  We plan on buying from cottage inn pizza.  The price listed for a large on Cottage Inn's website is 8.99 per pizza.  5*9 = $45.  Adding 6% sales tax and 20% tip (since we are planning on sitting down (to encourage member bonding) at the restaurant, tip will be a little higher), as well as 2 orders of breadsticks at $3 an order, the total comes to 62.7.  Depending on sign up this week, we may add another order of breadsticks, so we'd use the extra money requested for that.  
</li>
<li><b><u>Where else have you sought funding</u></b>:We have sought funding from the CSE department.  This semester we are throwing a lot more Community service events so this is our first semester really looking more for funding.  
</li>
