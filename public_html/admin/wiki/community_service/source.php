<b>Other</b> -- usually fill in remaining events with visits to local food kitchens or various events around Campus/Ann Arbor; events in town tend to get a higher turnout than events in Detroit; usually finish the semester with a "catch-all" that will enable a member who has started but not completed his/her community service to complete it by turning in 8 cans of food for 1 hour of service (this food will be donated to some charity of your choosing); the number of community service events per semester will vary depending on the interest we are getting from members and prospective members<!-- EDIT RECORD --><br /><br /><br />Last edited by Tony Lucchesi on November 27, 2011 at 11:09 AM
