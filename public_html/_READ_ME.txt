I hate these kinds of files so i'm not going to bore you.  But in that case...
I will however assume you are familiar with most of the content of HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and PHP on W3Schools.

Keep in mind
==========

* I'm still figuring this website out too

* You can only access the server when connected to CAEN

* The admin folder is only accessable through a uniquename being listed in the admin table in the database

* Member is a similar to admin

* Resumes say they are 404 unless, member, recuiter, or admin

* include "/top.php", "/side.php", and "/bottom.php" for your formatting

* when calling "/top.php" make sure $indirect is correctly used it should represent how deep you are in the folder tree
