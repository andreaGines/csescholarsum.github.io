	<p>After majoring in Chemistry at the University of California at San Diego, Dr. Brown received his Doctor of Optometry degree from the University of California at Berkeley School of Optometry in 1981. Upon graduation, John moved to Auburn, California, in the middle of the "Gold Country" of the Sierra Foothills. There, Dr. Brown created Sierra Optometry Center in 1982. After ten years of successful practice, John took a four-year sabbatical in order to spend time with his family, travel and ultimately relocate to a more metropolitan area. John chose to reside in the Puget Sound area because of the lifestyle and educational opportunities it afforded his son. He felt the Eastside area had a real need for an optometrist with his concern for patient welfare, his attention to detail, and his commitment to providing top quality materials and uncompromising service. Initially opening a practice in Kirkland in 1996, Dr. Brown opened Envision Optometry in downtown Bellevue in March of 1998. With the growth of the Bellevue practice demanding his full attention, John closed his Kirkland location in 2002.Dr. Brown's special areas of interest include glaucoma diagnosis and treatment; difficult contact lens cases and specialty contact lenses; dry eye treatment; nutritional supplements and visual health; children's vision, particularly the prevention of amblyopia (lazy eye) and reading difficulties; the etiology and control of myopia (nearsightedness). In addition to his optometric career, John enjoys scuba diving, photography, hiking, camping, skiing and bicycling. John's son, Jake, graduated from Juanita High in 2009 and is now an engineering student at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. John has a canine roommate, Buddy, who primarily just sheds hair and eats but is still greatly appreciated.</p>
